You can imagine how messy and chaotic that can get, especially when I receive about 50 emails per day. Sometimes I miss important work emails because they get buried under the avalanche of newsletters, promotions, and random offers. That’s why I was curious to try Shortwave, an email app created by ex-Googlers that claims to “cut through the noise”. And boy, did it deliver.The first thing that struck me about Shortwave was how it organises emails. As someone who hadn’t gone through the fine print (I assume most people wouldn’t), the interface did take some figuring out and getting used to. Shortwave sorts emails into categories: Updates, Promotions, Newsletters, or Social. This was super useful in helping me decide which emails to attend to and which ones to ignore.",

description:"It might not have totally disappeared, but the trusty 3.5 mm audio jack does seem well on its way out of our smartphone lives. Phones and tablets above Rs 20,000 are increasingly deserting the port, leaving their users with no choice but to go wireless for their personal audio or invest in a dongle to connect their wired earphones to the phone. The problem with dongles, however, is that many (like the ones from Apple and Google) add a 3.5 mm jack to your device but because they are plugged into the USB Type-C port of the device they are connected to, you often lose the option of using that port. It might not sound like a big deal, except when you suddenly realise that you need to charge your phone but do not want to stop listening to a song or podcast over your favourite pair of headphones.Dongles that plug into your phone or tablet and still give you access to a USB Type C port, as well as a 3.5 mm audio jack, do exist but either tend to cost a pretty penny or tend to add to the bulk of your device. The Ugreen USB-C to 3.5 mm audio adapter does neither, making it a great option for those who seek the best of both wired worlds – audio as well as charging.",

Think juicy baos, Talumeinsoup, chilli chicken, mushroom hot pot, street-style hakka noodles, lamb chops and more. All this over the last weekend at Okra in Marriott Hyderabad at the Flavours of Tangra food showcase.Born in Tangra, 31-year-old Robert grew up relishing Tangra flavours. He took to cooking when just 19 years but his formal culinary training began when the family migrated to Siliguri . There, he started assisting in his father’s restaurant and observing all the specialities made. Robert says “I started learning specialities while working full-time with my father I wasn’t just his helper, he let me cook as he instructed. Unfortunately, after a year, my father passed away and when I wanted to take over the restaurant, my mother asked me if I was confident enough in my skills to run the family-owned restaurant and pay her a rent of ₹50,000.",
